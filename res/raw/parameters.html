<h1>ABC Sequence</h1>

<p>The periodic sequence of As, Bs and Cs in which the degree of the growth of 
the population switches, whereas C causes an equation dependent value switch.</p>

<h1>Iterations</h1>

<p>The number of iterations used to calculate the Ljapunow exponent. The 
larger the number the better the exponent will be approximated.</p>

<h1>Warmup Rounds</h1>

<p>The number of initial iterates calculated to get rid of the critical points 
of the logistic function. Recommended to equal the length of the A-B sequence.</p>

<h1>A Interval</h1>

<p>The value interval of A for which to draw the fractal. This directly 
correlates to the x-axis range of the fractal to be drawn.</p>

<h1>B Interval</h1>

<p>The value interval of B for which to draw the fractal. This directly 
correlates to the y-axis range of the fractal to be drawn.</p>

<h1>X0</h1>

<p>The start value of the logistic function.</p>

<h1>Equation</h1>

<p>Equation to be used for calculating the fractal.</p>

<h1>Randomize</h1>

<p>Assign most of the parameters with random values.</p>
