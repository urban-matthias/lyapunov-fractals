<h1>Gradient Editor Usage</h1>

<p>The top gradient is a preview of the currently edited gradient. Click on it to accept 
it and finish the editor, drag it to rotate, saturate or brighten the gradient. Long click 
on it to choose if the gradient is rotated, saturated or brightened when dragging it.</p>

<p>Below the preview gradient the discrete colors of the edited gradient are listed. Colors 
can be added, removed, moved up and down.</p>

<p>The currently selected color is marked by a white border. It can be changed either by 
using the three gradients for main color, saturation and brightness, or by entering the color 
values directly by clicking on the current values.</p>

<p>The options menu let you load, save, discard, reverse, rotate, shuffle, randomize and 
duplicate gradients.</p>

<h1>Stable Region</h1>

<p>The gradient used to draw the stable regions of the fractal (i.e. negative exponents).</p>

<h1>Chaotic Region</h1>

<p>The gradient used to draw the chaotic regions of the fractal (i.e. positive exponents).</p>

<h1>One Gradient Only</h1>

<p>Use the gradient for stable regions to color the whole fractal.</p>

<h1>Colored Region</h1>

<p>Interval used to cut the stable and / or chaotic exponent peaks. Larger intervals 
result in clearer contours whereas smaller intervals increase the smoothness.</p>

<h1>Automatic Colored Region</h1>

<p>The interval used to cut the stable and / or chaotic exponent peaks is chosen automatically 
between -10 (stable region) and 10 (chaotic region).</p>

<h1>Cyclic Coloration</h1>

<p>Cyclic coloration of the fractal. Applies the gradients repeatedly according to the 
given factor (usually around 1000). Value 0 means no cyclic coloration.</p>

<h1>Histogram Equalization</h1>

<p>Histogram equalization of the fractal based on the calculated Ljapunow exponents.</p>

<h1>Gradations</h1>

<p>Number of gradations to be used for the gradients.</p>

<h1>Randomize</h1>

<p>Assign most of the color options with random values.</p>
